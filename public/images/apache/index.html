<h3>Call for Papers Opens for ApacheCon US 2008</h3>
<br/>
<h4 style="color:red;">Deadline for submissions: <strike>3 April 2008</strike> 7 April 2008</h4>

<p>
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) invites submissions to its
official conference, ApacheCon US 2008. To be held 3 November through
7 November, 2008 at the Sheraton New Orleans.  ApacheCon serves as a
forum for showcasing the ASF's latest developments, including its
projects, membership, and community.  Offering unparalleled
educational opportunities, with dedicated presentations, hands-on
trainings, and sessions that address core technology, development,
business/marketing, and licensing issues in Open Source.
</p>
<p>
The conference program includes competitively selected presentations,
trainings/workshops, and a small number of invited speakers. All
sessions undergo a peer review process by the ApacheCon Conference
Planning team.
</p>
<p>
With the great success of ApacheCon US 2007, we are excited to be in
New Orleans in 2008. And we are proud to announce that we are going to
intensify and deepen the pre-conference trainings by offering several
2-day trainings and each training session will have certifications of
completion for those to fulfill all the requirements of the training.
</p>
<p>
The ASF comprises some of the most active and recognized developers in
the Open Source community. By bringing together the pioneers,
developers, and users of flagship Open Source technologies, ApacheCon
provides an influential platform for dialogue, between the speaker and
the audience, between project contributors and the community at large,
traversing a wide range of ideas, expertise, and personalities.
</p>
<p>
ApacheCon welcomes submissions from like-minded delegates across many
fields, geographic locations, and areas of development. Please note
you do not have to be a member or committer with ASF to submit a
proposal. The unique nature of the Apache community lends itself to
creating a conference content that is not only the best of Open Source
but cutting edge as well.
